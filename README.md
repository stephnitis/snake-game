# Snake Game

## About

This project was created to practice and reinforce Vanilla Javascript skills.

Snake is a simple game where a player maneuvers a growing line (thematically the "snake"). The player must avoid the line hitting the boundaries, other obstacles or itself, which becomes increasingly challenging as the snake grows in length.

This project utilizes:

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML & HTML `<canvas>` which is used to draw graphics with JavaScript
